# flight-price-prediction
For purchasing an airplane ticket, the traditional purchase approach is to buy a ticket far in advance of the flightâ€™s departure date to avoid the risk that the price may increase quickly before the date of departure. However, this is not always the case; if airline corporations wish to increase sales, they can lower prices. Airlines employ a variety of factors to decide flight ticket rates, including whether the trip is around the holidays, the quantity of available seats on the plane, and even the month. Some of the variables can be seen, while others are hidden. In this context, customers are attempting to discover the best day to purchase a ticket, while airline firms, on the other hand, are attempting to maximize overall revenue.
